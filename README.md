This is a movie search application I built using React. The search will display the top 10 results of your typed keyword. You can then nominate or remove movies by clicking on said buttons.

### 6. Challenges and Learning

Some challenges I faced while working on this application was getting familiar with useState in React. In my Bootcamp we learned this near the end and only got to use it in my final project so I was kinda rusty looking back into it. Another difficulty I encountered with the project was getting the search list and nominated list to remove the movie when the remove button was clicked. The logic wasn't so obvious to me so I had to spend some time to figure out how to target and translate that into functioning code. Lastly, dealing with the styling of the application is always a bit more difficult than I always want. It ended up being good practice and I really got to learn my rows and columns again.
